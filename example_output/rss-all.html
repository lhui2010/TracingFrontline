The more stable East Antarctic Ice Sheet is larger and older, rests on higher topography, and hides entire mountain ranges and ancient lakes. The less stable West Antarctic Ice Sheet is smaller and younger and was formed on what was once a shallow sea. Recent observations made with several independent satellite measurements demonstrate that several regions of Antarctica are losing mass, flowing faster, and retreating where ice is exposed to warm ocean waters. The Antarctic contribution to sea level rise has reached ~8 millimeters since 1992. In the future, if warming ocean waters and increased surface meltwater trigger faster ice flow, sea level rise will accelerate.</p></div>

How much melting the ocean causes depends on the temperature of the water, which in turn is controlled by the combination of the thermal structure of the surrounding ocean and local ocean circulation, which in turn is determined largely by winds and bathymetry. As climate warms and atmospheric circulation changes, there will be follow-on changes in the ocean circulation and temperature. These consequences will affect the pace of mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p></div>

Some regions of the ice sheet may reach a tipping point, potentially leading to rates of sea level rise at least an order of magnitude larger than those observed now, owing to strong positive feedbacks in the ice-climate system. How fast and how much Antarctica will contribute to sea level remains uncertain, but multimeter sea level rise is likely for a mean global temperature increase of around 2&deg;C above preindustrial levels on multicentennial time scales, or sooner for unmitigated scenarios.</p></div>

We demonstrate conversion of thermal radiation into electrical power using a bipolar grating-coupled complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) tunnel diode. A two-step photon-assisted tunneling charge pumping mechanism results in separation of charge carriers in pn-junction wells leading to a large open-circuit voltage developed across a load. Electrical power generation from a broadband blackbody thermal source has been experimentally demonstrated with converted power densities of 27 to 61 microwatts per square centimeter for thermal sources between 250&deg; and 400&deg;C. Scalable, efficient conversion of radiated waste heat into electrical power can be used to reduce energy consumption or to power electronics and sensors.</p></div>

We address these complexities along 3500 kilometers of the extreme climate and vegetation gradient of the Andean Western Cordillera (6&deg;S to 36&deg;S latitude) using 86 cosmogenic radionuclide&ndash;derived, millennial time scale erosion rates and multivariate statistics. We identify a bidirectional response to vegetation&rsquo;s influence on erosion whereby correlations between vegetation cover and erosion range from negative (dry, sparsely vegetated settings) to positive (wetter, more vegetated settings).

We found that methylphenidate boosts willingness to expend cognitive effort by altering the benefit-to-cost ratio of cognitive work. Willingness to expend effort was greater for participants with higher striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, whereas methylphenidate and sulpiride, a selective D2 receptor antagonist, increased cognitive motivation more for participants with lower synthesis capacity. A sequential sampling model informed by momentary gaze revealed that decisions to expend effort are related to amplification of benefit-versus-cost information attended early in the decision process, whereas the effect of benefits is strengthened with higher synthesis capacity and by methylphenidate.

Mitochondrial division involves Dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) oligomerization, which constricts membranes at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites. The mechanisms driving the final steps of mitochondrial division are still unclear. Here, we found that microdomains of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] on trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles were recruited to mitochondria&ndash;ER contact sites and could drive mitochondrial division downstream of Drp1. The loss of the small guanosine triphosphatase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) or its effector, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III&beta; [PI(4)KIII&beta;], in different mammalian cell lines prevented PI(4)P generation and led to a hyperfused and branched mitochondrial network marked with extended mitochondrial constriction sites.

By integrating engineered-enzyme targeting and polymer chemistry, we genetically instructed specific living neurons to guide chemical synthesis of electrically functional (conductive or insulating) polymers at the plasma membrane. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses confirmed that rationally designed, genetically targeted assembly of functional polymers not only preserved neuronal viability but also achieved remodeling of membrane properties and modulated cell type&ndash;specific behaviors in freely moving animals.

Here, a bi-adjuvant neoantigen nanovaccine (banNV) that codelivered a peptide neoantigen (Adpgk) with two adjuvants [Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 and TLR9 agonist CpG] was developed for potent cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, banNVs were prepared by a nanotemplated synthesis of concatemer CpG, nanocondensation with cationic polypeptides, and then physical loading with hydrophobic R848 and Adpgk. The immunogenicity of the neoantigen was profoundly potentiated by efficient codelivery of neoantigen and dual synergistic adjuvants, which is accompanied by reduced acute systemic toxicity. BanNVs sensitized immune checkpoint programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) on T cells, therefore, a combination of banNVs with aPD-1 conspicuously induced the therapy response and led to complete regression of 70% neoantigen-specific tumors without recurrence. We conclude that banNVs are promising to optimize personalized therapeutic neoantigen vaccines for cancer immunotherapy.</p></div>

This study presents a framework for such verification. This framework reveals that previously published results based on a 1961&ndash;2005 attribution period frequently underestimate the influence of global warming on the probability of unprecedented extremes during the 2006&ndash;2017 period. This underestimation is particularly pronounced for hot and wet events, with greater uncertainty for dry events. The underestimation is reflected in discrepancies between probabilities predicted during the attribution period and frequencies observed during the out-of-sample verification period. These discrepancies are most explained by increases in climate forcing between the attribution and verification periods, suggesting that 21st-century global warming has substantially increased the probability of unprecedented hot and wet events. Hence, the use of temporally lagged periods for attribution&mdash;and, more broadly, for extreme event probability quantification&mdash;can cause underestimation of historical impacts, and current and future risks.</p></div>

Here, we present data indicating that YAP1 may be a strong driver of the onset and progression of oral SCC (OSCC), a major subtype of HNSCC. Mice with tongue-specific deletion of <I>Mob1a/b</I> and thus endogenous YAP1 hyperactivation underwent surprisingly rapid and highly reproducible tumorigenesis, developing tongue carcinoma in situ within 2 weeks and invasive SCC within 4 weeks. In humans, precancerous tongue dysplasia displays YAP1 activation correlating with reduced patient survival. Combinations of molecules mutated in OSCC may increase and sustain YAP1 activation to the point of oncogenicity. Strikingly, siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 blocks murine OSCC onset in vitro and in vivo. Our work justifies targeting YAP1 as therapy for OSCC and perhaps HNSCC, and our mouse model represents a powerful tool for evaluating these agents.</p></div>

Using comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of published data and novel experimental approaches, we reveal that efforts to assay 6mdA in mammals have been severely compromised by bacterial contamination, RNA contamination, technological limitations, and antibody nonspecificity. These complications render 6mdA an exceptionally problematic DNA modification to study and have resulted in erroneous detection of 6mdA in several mammalian systems.

Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons (CRHNs) control stress hormones but how diverse stressors converge on CRHNs is poorly understood. We used sRNA profiling to define CRHN receptors for neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and then viral tracing to localize subsets of upstream neurons expressing cognate receptor ligands. Unexpectedly, one subset comprised POMC (proopiomelanocortin)&ndash;expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus, which are linked to appetite suppression. The POMC neurons were activated by one psychological stressor, physical restraint, but not another, a predator odor. Chemogenetic activation of POMC neurons induced a stress hormone response, mimicking a stressor. Moreover, their silencing markedly reduced the stress hormone response to physical restraint, but not predator odor. These findings indicate that POMC neurons involved in appetite suppression also play a major role in the stress hormone response to a specific type of psychological stressor.</p></div>

Here, we describe a high-throughput method that directs simultaneous assembly of multiple cell types and solid-phase ligands across length scales within minutes. Our method involves lithographically defining hierarchical patterns of unique DNA oligonucleotides to which complementary strands, attached to cells and ligands-of-interest, hybridize. Highlighting our method&rsquo;s power, we investigated how the spatial presentation of self-renewal ligand fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and differentiation signal ephrin-B2 instruct single adult neural stem cell (NSC) fate. We found that NSCs have a strong spatial bias toward FGF-2 and identified an unexpected subpopulation exhibiting high neuronal differentiation despite spatially occupying patterned FGF-2 regions. Overall, our broadly applicable, DNA-directed approach enables mechanistic insight into how tissues encode regulatory information through the spatial presentation of heterogeneous signals.</p></div>

Our studies originated from the observation of microvascular platelet retention in a rat cardiac surgery model. Ensuing work supported the proximity of platelet aggregates with perivascular mast cells (MCs) and demonstrated that platelet activation triggered systemic MC activation. We then identified platelet activating factor (PAF) as the platelet-derived mediator stimulating MCs and, using chimeric animals with platelets defective in PAF generation or MCs lacking PAF receptor, defined the role of this platelet-MC interaction for vascular leakage, shock, and tissue inflammation. In application of these findings, we demonstrated that inhibition of platelet activation in modeled cardiac surgery blunted MC-dependent inflammation and tissue injury. Together, our work identifies a previously undefined mechanism of inflammatory augmentation, in which platelets trigger local and systemic responses through activation of perivascular MCs.</p></div>

We use panel data on all business establishments in the eight-state Mountain West region to estimate economic impacts of 14 monument designations over a 25-year period. We find that monuments increased the average number of establishments and jobs in areas near monuments; increased the average establishment growth rate; had no effect, positive or negative, on the number of jobs in establishments that existed pre-designation; and had no effect on mining and other industries that use public lands.

Here, we demonstrate an in situ synthetic strategy of bioactive zeolitic imidazolate framework-8&ndash;capped ceria nanoparticles (CeO<SUB>2</SUB>@ZIF-8 NPs) to achieve enhanced catalytic and antioxidative activities and improved stroke therapeutic efficacy. This nanosystem exhibits prolonged blood circulation time, reduced clearance rate, improved BBB penetration ability, and enhanced brain accumulation, where it effectively inhibits the lipid peroxidation in brain tissues in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice and reduces the oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons in brain tissue. CeO<SUB>2</SUB>@ZIF-8 also suppresses inflammation- and immune response&ndash;induced injury by suppressing the activation of astrocytes and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, thus achieving satisfactory prevention and treatment in neuroprotective therapy.

Nanobiohybrids use synthetic nanomaterials to impart organisms with emergent properties outside their scope of evolution. Consequently, they endow new or augmented properties that are either innate or exogenous, such as enhanced tolerance against stress, programmed metabolism and proliferation, artificial photosynthesis, or conductivity. Advances in new materials design and processing technologies made it possible to tailor the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials coupled with the biological systems. To date, many different types of nanomaterials have been integrated with various biological systems from simple biomolecules to complex multicellular organisms. Here, we provide a critical overview of recent developments of nanobiohybrids that enable new or augmented biological functions that show promise in high-tech applications across many disciplines, including energy harvesting, biocatalysis, biosensing, medicine, and robotics.</p></div>

Here, we examined regulation of GABA transmission in the medial subdivision of the central amygdala (CeM) by the SP/NK-1R system, and its neuroadaptation following chronic alcohol exposure. In nai&#x0308;ve rats, SP increased action potential&ndash;dependent GABA release, and the selective NK-1R antagonist L822429 decreased it, demonstrating SP regulation of CeM activity under basal conditions. SP induced a larger GABA release in alcohol-dependent rats accompanied by decreased NK-1R expression compared to nai&#x0308;ve controls, suggesting NK-1R hypersensitivity which persisted during protracted alcohol withdrawal. The NK-1R antagonist blocked acute alcohol-induced GABA release in alcohol-dependent and withdrawn but not in nai&#x0308;ve rats, indicating that dependence engages the SP/NK-1R system to mediate acute effects of alcohol. Collectively, we report long-lasting CeA NK-1R hypersensitivity corroborating that NK-1Rs are promising targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.</p></div>

However, as measurement precision increases, there is mounting evidence for some small but substantive regional (partly growing season) offsets in same-year radiocarbon levels. Controlling for interlaboratory variation, we compare radiocarbon data from Europe and the Mediterranean in the second to earlier first millennia BCE. Consistent with recent findings in the second millennium CE, these data suggest that some small, but critical, periods of variation for Mediterranean radiocarbon levels exist, especially associated with major reversals or plateaus in the atmospheric radiocarbon record. At high precision, these variations potentially affect calendar dates for prehistory by up to a few decades, including, for example, Egyptian history and the much-debated Thera/Santorini volcanic eruption.</p></div>

Male and female behaviors may have played unique roles in the likely coevolution of increasing brain volume and more complex social dynamics. To explore possible divergence in social brain morphology between men and women living in different social environments, we applied probabilistic generative modeling to ~10,000 UK Biobank participants. We observed strong volume effects especially in the limbic system but also in regions of the sensory, intermediate, and higher association networks. Sex-specific brain volume effects in the limbic system were linked to the frequency and intensity of social contact, such as indexed by loneliness, household size, and social support. Across the processing hierarchy of neural networks, different conditions for social interplay may resonate in and be influenced by brain anatomy in sex-dependent ways.</p></div>

General relativity predicts that embedded within this image lies a thin "photon ring," which is composed of an infinite sequence of self-similar subrings that are indexed by the number of photon orbits around the black hole. The subrings approach the edge of the black hole "shadow," becoming exponentially narrower but weaker with increasing orbit number, with seemingly negligible contributions from high-order subrings. Here, we show that these subrings produce strong and universal signatures on long interferometric baselines. These signatures offer the possibility of precise measurements of black hole mass and spin, as well as tests of general relativity, using only a sparse interferometric array.</p></div>

Here, we report a specific role for TRPC1 in the entry of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) into cells. HSV-1&ndash;induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and entry were dependent on Orai1, STIM1, and TRPC1. Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry or knockdown of these proteins attenuated viral entry and infection. HSV-1 glycoprotein D interacted with the third ectodomain of TRPC1, and this interaction facilitated viral entry. Knockout of TRPC1 attenuated HSV-1&ndash;induced ocular abnormality and morbidity in vivo in TRPC1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. There was a strong correlation between HSV-1 infection and plasma membrane localization of TRPC1 in epithelial cells within oral lesions in buccal biopsies from HSV-1&ndash;infected patients.

These findings carry important policy-relevant implications: The observationally constrained CMIP6 median warming in high emissions and ambitious mitigation scenarios is over 16 and 14% lower by 2050 compared to the raw CMIP6 median, respectively, and over 14 and 8% lower by 2090, relative to 1995&ndash;2014.

This tuning has implications for intraspecies communication, the maintenance of species boundaries, and speciation. Tuning of color vision largely depends on the sequence of the expressed opsin proteins. To improve tuning of visual sensitivities to shifts in habitat or foraging ecology over the course of development, many organisms change which opsins are expressed. Changes in this developmental sequence (heterochronic shifts) can create differences in visual sensitivity among closely related species. The genetic mechanisms by which these developmental shifts occur are poorly understood. Here, we use QTL analyses, genome sequencing, and gene expression studies in African cichlid fishes to identify a role for the transcription factor Tbx2a in driving a switch between <span style="font-style:italic;">LWS</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">RH2</span> opsin expression. We identify binding sites for Tbx2a in the <span style="font-style:italic;">LWS</span> promoter and the highly conserved Locus Control Region of <span style="font-style:italic;">RH2</span> which concurrently promote <span style="font-style:italic;">LWS</span> expression while repressing <span style="font-style:italic;">RH2</span> expression. We also present evidence that a single change in <span style="font-style:italic;">Tbx2a</span> regulatory sequence has led to a species difference in visual tuning, providing the first mechanistic model for the evolution of rapid switches in sensory tuning. This difference in visual tuning likely has important roles in evolution as it corresponds to differences in diet, microhabitat choice, and male nuptial coloration.</span></div>

This procedure ranks a set of candidate models according to their goodness-of-fit to the data, commonly using an information theoretic criterion. Users then specify the best-ranking model for inference. While it is often assumed that better-fitting models translate to increase accuracy, recent studies have shown that the specific model employed may not substantially affect inferences. We examine whether there is a systematic relationship between relative model fit and topological inference accuracy in protein phylogenetics, using simulations and real sequences. Simulations employed site-heterogeneous mechanistic codon models that are distinct from protein-level phylogenetic inference models. This strategy allows us to investigate how protein models performs when they are misspecified to the data, as will be the case for any real sequence analysis. We broadly find that phylogenies inferred across models with vastly different fits to the data produce highly consistent topologies. We additionally find that all models infer similar proportions of false positive splits, raising the possibility that all available models of protein evolution are similarly misspecified. Moreover, we find that the parameter-rich GTR model, whose amino-acid exchangeabilities are free parameters, performs similarly to models with fixed exchangeabilities, although the inference precision associated with GTR models was not examined. We conclude that, while relative model selection may not hinder phylogenetic analysis on protein data, it may not offer specific predictable improvements and is not a reliable proxy for accuracy.</span></div>

Here, we analyze the transcriptome across fruiting body development to understand the independent evolution of complex multicellularity in the two largest clades of fungi—the Agarico- and Pezizomycotina. Despite &gt;650 million years of divergence between these clades, we find that very similar sets of genes have convergently been co-opted for complex multicellularity, followed by expansions of their gene families by duplications. Over 82% of shared multicellularity-related gene families were expanding in both clades, indicating a high prevalence of convergence also at the gene-family level. This convergence is coupled with a rich inferred repertoire of multicellularity-related genes in the most recent common ancestor of the Agarico- and Pezizomycotina, consistent with the hypothesis that the coding capacity of ancestral fungal genomes might have promoted the repeated evolution of complex multicellularity. We interpret this repertoire as an indication of evolutionary predisposition of fungal ancestors for evolving complex multicellular fruiting bodies. Our work suggests that evolutionary convergence may happen not only when organisms are closely related or are under similar selection pressures, but also when ancestral genomic repertoires render certain evolutionary trajectories more likely than others, even across large phylogenetic distances.</span></div>

Although the recent boom in genotype–phenotype studies has led to a greater understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of a variety of traits, studies identifying the genetic basis of behaviors are, comparatively, still lacking. This is likely because they are complex and environmentally sensitive phenotypes, making them difficult to measure reliably for association studies. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Drosophila</span> species complex holds promise for addressing these challenges, as the behaviors of closely related species can be readily assayed in a common environment. Here, we investigate the genetic basis of an evolved behavioral difference, pupation site choice, between <span style="font-style:italic;">Drosophila melanogaster</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">D. simulans</span>. In this study, we demonstrate a significant contribution of the X chromosome to the difference in pupation site choice behavior between these species.

Aquatic vertebrates in particular show high variability in chromatic vision and have become important models for understanding the role of color vision in prey detection, predator avoidance, and social interactions. In this study, we examined the capacity for chromatic vision in elasmobranch fishes, a group that have received relatively little attention to date. We used microspectrophotometry to measure the spectral absorbance of the visual pigments in the outer segments of individual photoreceptors from several ray and shark species, and we sequenced the opsin mRNAs obtained from the retinas of the same species, as well as from additional elasmobranch species. We reveal the phylogenetically widespread occurrence of dichromatic color vision in rays based on two cone opsins, RH2 and LWS. We also confirm that all shark species studied to date appear to be cone monochromats but report that in different species the single cone opsin may be of either the LWS or the RH2 class. From this, we infer that cone monochromacy in sharks has evolved independently on multiple occasions. Together with earlier discoveries in secondarily aquatic marine mammals, this suggests that cone-based color vision may be of little use for large marine predators, such as sharks, pinnipeds, and cetaceans.</span></div>

Here we report that an Antarctic strain of <span style="font-style:italic;">Chlorella vulgaris</span>, called NJ-7, acquired the capability to grow at near 0 °C temperatures and greatly enhanced freezing tolerance after systematic increases in abundance of enzymes/proteins and positive selection of certain genes. Having diverged from the temperate strain UTEX259 of the same species 2.5 (1.1–4.1) to 2.6 (1.0–4.5) Ma, NJ-7 retained the basic mesophilic characteristics and genome structures. Nitrate reductases in the two strains are highly similar in amino acid sequence and optimal temperature, but the NJ-7 one showed significantly higher abundance and activity. Quantitative proteomic analyses indicated that several cryoprotective proteins (LEA), many enzymes involved in carbon metabolism and a large number of other enzymes/proteins, were more abundant in NJ-7 than in UTEX259. Like nitrate reductase, most of these enzymes were not upregulated in response to cold stress. Thus, compensation of low specific activities by increased enzyme abundance appears to be an important strategy for early stage cold adaptation to Antarctica, but such enzymes are mostly not involved in cold acclimation upon transfer from favorable temperatures to near 0 °C temperatures.</span></div>

To measure rates and patterns of somatic mutations, we analyzed transcriptomes from 17 to 22 branches from each of four <span style="font-style:italic;">Acropora hyacinthus</span> colonies, determined putative single nucleotide variants, and verified them with Sanger resequencing.

Bone, tooth, and dental calculus samples were collected from 124 individuals from three precontact archaeological sites: Tibes, Punta Candelero, and Paso del Indio. Despite poor DNA preservation, we used target enrichment and high-throughput sequencing to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) from 45 individuals and autosomal genotypes from two individuals. We found a high proportion of Native American mtDNA haplogroups A2 and C1 in the precontact Puerto Rico sample (40% and 44%, respectively). This distribution, as well as the haplotypes represented, supports a primarily Amazonian South American origin for these populations and mirrors the Native American mtDNA diversity patterns found in present-day islanders. Three mtDNA haplotypes from precontact Puerto Rico persist among Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean islanders, indicating that present-day populations are reservoirs of precontact mtDNA diversity. Lastly, we find similarity in autosomal ancestry patterns between precontact individuals from Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, suggesting a shared component of Indigenous Caribbean ancestry with close affinity to South American populations.

The most commonly used reduced representation data sets for phylogenomics are ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE). Here, we introduce Rapidly Evolving Long Exon Capture (RELEC), a new set of loci that targets single exons that are both rapidly evolving (evolutionary rate faster than <span style="font-style:italic;">RAG1</span>) and relatively long in length (&gt;1,500 bp), while at the same time avoiding paralogy issues across amniotes. We compare the RELEC data set to UCEs and AHE in squamate reptiles by aligning and analyzing orthologous sequences from 17 squamate genomes, composed of 10 snakes and 7 lizards. The RELEC data set (179 loci) outperforms AHE and UCEs by maximizing per-locus genetic variation while maintaining presence and orthology across a range of evolutionary scales. RELEC markers show higher phylogenetic informativeness than UCE and AHE loci, and RELEC gene trees show greater similarity to the species tree than AHE or UCE gene trees. Furthermore, with fewer loci, RELEC remains computationally tractable for full Bayesian coalescent species tree analyses.

A common finding in studies of aphid genomes is the presence of a large number of duplicated genes. However, when these duplications occurred remains unclear, partly due to the high relatedness of sequenced species. To better understand the origin of aphid duplications we sequenced and assembled the genome of <span style="font-style:italic;">Cinara cedri</span>, an early branching lineage (Lachninae) of the Aphididae family. We performed a phylogenomic comparison of this genome with 20 other sequenced genomes, including the available genomes of five other aphids, along with the transcriptomes of two species belonging to Adelgidae (a closely related clade to the aphids) and Coccoidea. We found that gene duplication has been pervasive throughout the evolution of aphids, including many parallel waves of recent, species-specific duplications. Most notably, we identified a consistent set of very ancestral duplications, originating from a large-scale gene duplication predating the diversification of Aphidomorpha (comprising aphids, phylloxerids, and adelgids). Genes duplicated in this ancestral wave are enriched in functions related to traits shared by Aphidomorpha, such as association with endosymbionts, and adaptation to plant defenses and phloem-sap-based diet. The ancestral nature of this duplication wave (106–227 Ma) and the lack of sufficiently conserved synteny make it difficult to conclude whether it originated from a whole-genome duplication event or, alternatively, from a burst of large-scale segmental duplications. Genome sequencing of other aphid species belonging to different Aphidomorpha and related lineages may clarify these findings.</span></div>

The diets of birds are highly variable, making them an excellent model system for studying adaptive evolution driven by dietary changes. To test whether molecular adaptations to diet have occurred during the evolution of birds, we examined a dietary enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which tends to target mitochondria in carnivorous mammals, peroxisomes in herbivorous mammals, and both mitochondria and peroxisomes in omnivorous mammals. A total of 31 bird species were examined in this study, which included representatives of most major avian lineages. Of these, 29 have an intact mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of AGT. This finding is in stark contrast to mammals, which showed a number of independent losses of the MTS. Our cell-based functional assays revealed that the efficiency of AGT mitochondrial targeting was greatly reduced in unrelated lineages of granivorous birds, yet it tended to be high in insectivorous and carnivorous lineages. Furthermore, we found that proportions of animal tissue in avian diets were positively correlated with mitochondrial targeting efficiencies that were experimentally determined, but not with those that were computationally predicted. Adaptive evolution of AGT mitochondrial targeting in birds was further supported by the detection of positive selection on MTS regions. Our study contributes to the understanding of how diet drives molecular adaptations in animals, and suggests that caution must be taken when computationally predicting protein subcellular targeting.</span></div>

Together with the signature of positive selection, our findings suggest that Arp2D may augment Arp2’s functions in the male germline. Indeed, we find that Arp2D is expressed during and following male meiosis, where it localizes to distinct locations such as actin cones—specialized cytoskeletal structures that separate bundled spermatids into individual mature sperm.

We examined genome-wide variation of 42 trees from Hawaii Island and older islands. Results revealed a split between glaberrima and newellii within the past 0.3–1.2 My. Admixture was extensive between lineages within Hawaii Island and between islands, but introgression from populations on older islands (i.e., secondary gene flow) did not appear to contribute to the emergence of newellii. In contrast, recurrent gene flow (i.e., primary gene flow) between glaberrima and newellii contributed to the formation of genomic islands of elevated absolute and relative divergence. These regions were enriched for genes with regulatory functions as well as for signals of positive selection, especially in newellii, consistent with divergent selection underlying their formation. In sum, our results support riparian newellii as a rare case of incipient ecological speciation with primary gene flow in trees.</span></div>

Although numerous studies have examined prezygotic isolation in darters (Percidae), investigations into postzygotic barriers have remained rare due to long generation times and a lack of genomic resources. Orangethroat and rainbow darters naturally hybridize and provide a remarkable example of male-driven speciation via character displacement. Backcross hybrids suffer from high mortality, which appears to promote behavioral isolation in sympatry. To investigate the genomic architecture of postzygotic isolation, we used Illumina and PacBio sequencing to generate a chromosome-level, annotated assembly of the orangethroat darter genome and high-density linkage maps for orangethroat and rainbow darters. We also analyzed genome-wide RADseq data from wild-caught adults of both species and laboratory-generated backcrosses to identify genomic regions associated with hybrid incompatibles. Several putative chromosomal translocations and inversions were observed between orangethroat and rainbow darters, suggesting structural rearrangements may underlie postzygotic isolation. We also found evidence of selection against recombinant haplotypes and transmission ratio distortion in backcross hybrid genomes, providing further insight into the genomic architecture of genetic incompatibilities. Notably, regions with high levels of genetic divergence between species were enriched for genes associated with developmental and meiotic processes, providing strong candidates for postzygotic isolating barriers. These findings mark significant contributions to our understanding of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation between species undergoing character displacement. Furthermore, the genomic resources presented here will be instrumental for studying speciation in darters, the most diverse vertebrate group in North America.</span></div>

This phenomenon may be mainly attributed to the enzyme that modifies or mutates the genetic material, because most enzymes tend to have specific sequence contexts that dictate their activity. Here, we develop a statistical model that allows for the detection and evaluation of the effects of different sequence contexts on mutation rates from deep population sequencing data. This task is computationally challenging, as the complexity of the model increases exponentially as the context size increases. We established our novel Bayesian method based on sparse model selection methods, with the leading assumption that the number of actual sequence contexts that directly influence mutation rates is minuscule compared with the number of possible sequence contexts. We show that our method is highly accurate on simulated data using pentanucleotide contexts, even when accounting for noisy data. We next analyze empirical population sequencing data from polioviruses and HIV-1 and detect a significant enrichment in sequence contexts associated with deamination by the cellular deaminases ADAR 1/2 and APOBEC3G, respectively. In the current era, where next-generation sequencing data are highly abundant, our approach can be used on any population sequencing data to reveal context-dependent base alterations and may assist in the discovery of novel mutable sites or editing sites.</span></div>

We extracted numerous minute mites from soils in an area of mixed forest and grassland in southern Iberia. Selected specimens representing the full morphological diversity were shotgun sequenced in bulk, followed by genome assembly of short reads from the mixture, which produced &gt;100 mitochondrial genomes representing diverse acarine lineages. Phylogenetic analyses in combination with taxonomically limited mitogenomes available publicly resulted in plausible trees defining basal relationships of the Acari. Several critical nodes were supported by ancestral-state reconstructions of mitochondrial gene rearrangements. Molecular calibration placed the minimum age for the common ancestor of the superorder Acariformes, which includes most soil-dwelling mites, to the Cambrian–Ordovician (likely within 455–552 Ma), whereas the origin of the superorder Parasitiformes was placed later in the Carboniferous-Permian. Most family-level taxa within the Acariformes were dated to the Jurassic and Triassic. The ancient origin of Acariformes and the early diversification of major extant lineages linked to the soil are consistent with a pioneering role for mites in building the earliest terrestrial ecosystems.</span></div>

Unexpectedly, the nonrecombining mating-type chromosomes showed lower divergence than autosomes due to higher gene flow, which may be promoted by adaptive introgressions of less degenerated mating-type chromosomes. The fact that both mating-type chromosomes are always heterozygous and nonrecombining may explain such patterns that oppose to those found for XY or ZW sex chromosomes.

A hallmark for balancing selection in humans is the heterozygote advantage at genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), resulting in improved HIV-1 control. However, the actual mechanism of the observed heterozygote advantage is still elusive. HLA heterozygotes may present a broader array of antigenic viral peptides to immune cells, possibly resulting in a more efficient cytotoxic T-cell response. Alternatively, heterozygosity may simply increase the chance to carry the most protective HLA alleles, as individual HLA alleles are known to differ substantially in their association with HIV-1 control. Here, we used data from 6,311 HIV-1-infected individuals to explore the relative contribution of quantitative and qualitative aspects of peptide presentation in HLA heterozygote advantage against HIV. Screening the entire HIV-1 proteome, we observed that heterozygous individuals exhibited a broader array of HIV-1 peptides presented by their HLA class I alleles.

If the neutral condition is violated, the impact of ILS may change, altering the gene tree distribution. Here, we show that under purifying selection, even assuming that the fitness effect of mutations is constant throughout the species tree, if differences in population size exist among species, asymmetric distributions of gene trees will arise, which is different from the expectation under neutrality. In extremes, one of the discordant trees rather than the concordant tree becomes the most frequent gene tree. In addition, we found that in a real case, the position of Scandentia relative to Primate and Glires, the symmetry in the gene tree distribution can be influenced by the strength of purifying selection.

Here, we examined genome-wide distributions of small RNAs in the sperm and egg cells of rice. We found that 24-nt siRNAs, which are a hallmark of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants, were depleted from heterochromatin boundaries in both gametes relative to vegetative tissues, reminiscent of siRNA patterns in DDM1-type nucleosome remodeler mutants. In sperm cells, 24-nt siRNAs were spread across heterochromatic regions, while in egg cells, 24-nt siRNAs were concentrated at a smaller number of heterochromatic loci throughout the genome, especially at loci which also produced siRNAs in other tissues. In both gametes, patterns of CHH methylation, typically a strong indicator of RdDM, were similar to vegetative tissues, although lower in magnitude. These findings indicate that the small RNA transcriptome undergoes large-scale redistribution in both male and female gametes, which is not correlated with recruitment of DNA methyltransferases in gametes and suggestive of unexplored regulatory activities of gamete small RNAs.</p></div>

Existing methods rely on population allele frequency information for accurate estimation of contamination rates. Correctly specifying population allele frequencies for each individual in early stage of sequence analysis is impractical or even impossible for large-scale sequencing centers that simultaneously process samples from multiple studies across diverse populations. On the other hand, incorrectly specified allele frequencies may result in substantial bias in estimated contamination rates. For example, we observed that existing methods often fail to identify 10% contaminated samples at a typical 3% contamination exclusion threshold when genetic ancestry is misspecified. Such an incomplete screening of contaminated samples substantially inflates the estimated rate of genotyping errors even in deeply sequenced genomes and exomes. We propose a robust statistical method that accurately estimates DNA contamination and is agnostic to genetic ancestry of the intended or contaminating sample. Our method integrates the estimation of genetic ancestry and DNA contamination in a unified likelihood framework by leveraging individual-specific allele frequencies projected from reference genotypes onto principal component coordinates. Our method can also be used for estimating genetic ancestries, similar to LASER or <I>TRACE</I>, but simultaneously accounting for potential contamination. We demonstrate that our method robustly estimates contamination rates and genetic ancestries across populations and contamination scenarios. We further demonstrate that, in the presence of contamination, genetic ancestry inference can be substantially biased with existing methods that ignore contamination, while our method corrects for such biases.</p></div>

However, because of technical limitations, scRNA-seq data often contain zero counts for many transcripts in individual cells. These zero counts, or dropout events, complicate the analysis of scRNA-seq data using standard methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data. Current scRNA-seq analysis methods typically overcome dropout by combining information across cells in a lower-dimensional space, leveraging the observation that cells generally occupy a small number of RNA expression states. We introduce netNMF-sc, an algorithm for scRNA-seq analysis that leverages information across both cells and genes. netNMF-sc learns a low-dimensional representation of scRNA-seq transcript counts using network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization. The network regularization takes advantage of prior knowledge of gene&ndash;gene interactions, encouraging pairs of genes with known interactions to be nearby each other in the low-dimensional representation. The resulting matrix factorization imputes gene abundance for both zero and nonzero counts and can be used to cluster cells into meaningful subpopulations. We show that netNMF-sc outperforms existing methods at clustering cells and estimating gene&ndash;gene covariance using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, with increasing advantages at higher dropout rates (e.g., &gt;60%). We also show that the results from netNMF-sc are robust to variation in the input network, with more representative networks leading to greater performance gains.</p></div>

We have designed a multitask and multimodal deep neural network for characterizing in vivo RBP targets. The model incorporates not only the sequence but also the region type of the binding sites as input, which helps the model to boost the prediction performance. To interpret the model, we quantified the contribution of the input features to the predictive score of each RBP. Learning across multiple RBPs at once, we are able to avoid experimental biases and to identify the RNA sequence motifs and transcript context patterns that are the most important for the predictions of each individual RBP.

However, the global patterns of these interwoven heterogeneous interactomes remain poorly understood. Here we focus on two different interactomes, chromatin interaction network and gene regulatory network, as a proof of principle to identify heterogeneous interactome modules (HIMs), each of which represents a cluster of gene loci that is in spatial contact more frequently than expected and that is regulated by the same group of transcription factors. HIM integrates transcription factor binding and 3D genome structure to reflect "transcriptional niche" in the nucleus. We develop a new algorithm, MOCHI, to facilitate the discovery of HIMs based on network motif clustering in heterogeneous interactomes. By applying MOCHI to five different cell types, we found that HIMs have strong spatial preference within the nucleus and show distinct functional properties. Through integrative analysis, this work shows the utility of MOCHI to identify HIMs, which may provide new perspectives on the interplay between transcriptional regulation and 3D genome organization.</p></div>

Much has been learnt about bacterial genomes by creating large mutant libraries and looking for conditionally important genes. However, current genome-wide methods are largely unable to assay essential genes which are not amenable to disruption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new version of "TraDIS" (transposon directed insertion-site sequencing) that we term "TraDIS-Xpress" that combines an inducible promoter into the transposon cassette. This allows controlled overexpression and repression of all genes owing to saturation of inserts adjacent to all open reading frames as well as conventional inactivation. We applied TraDIS-Xpress to identify responses to the biocide triclosan across a range of concentrations. Triclosan is endemic in modern life, but there is uncertainty about its mode of action with a concentration-dependent switch from bacteriostatic to bactericidal action unexplained. Our results show a concentration-dependent response to triclosan with different genes important in survival between static and cidal exposures. These genes include those previously reported to have a role in triclosan resistance as well as a new set of genes, including essential genes. Novel genes identified as being sensitive to triclosan exposure include those involved in barrier function, small molecule uptake, and integrity of transcription and translation. We anticipate the approach we show here, by allowing comparisons across multiple experimental conditions of TraDIS data, and including essential genes, will be a starting point for future work examining how different drug conditions impact bacterial survival mechanisms.</p></div>

In addition, when samples from multiple tissues were studied in a comparative framework, individuals and tissues were confounded. We designed a multitissue comparative study of gene expression and DNA methylation in primates that minimizes confounding effects by using a balanced design with respect to species, tissues, and individuals. We also developed a comparative analysis pipeline that minimizes biases attributable to sequence divergence. Thus, we present the most comprehensive catalog of similarities and differences in gene expression and DNA methylation levels between livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs, in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We estimate that overall, interspecies and inter-tissue differences in gene expression levels can only modestly be accounted for by corresponding differences in promoter DNA methylation. However, the expression pattern of genes with conserved inter-tissue expression differences can be explained by corresponding interspecies methylation changes more often. Finally, we show that genes whose tissue-specific regulatory patterns are consistent with the action of natural selection are highly connected in both gene regulatory and protein&ndash;protein interaction networks.</p></div>

However, reads derived from the current RNA-seq technologies are usually short and deprived of information on modification, compromising their potential in defining transcriptome complexity. Here, we applied a direct RNA sequencing method with ultralong reads using Oxford Nanopore Technologies to study the transcriptome complexity in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. We generated approximately six million reads using native poly(A)-tailed mRNAs from three developmental stages, with average read lengths ranging from 900 to 1100 nt. Around half of the reads represent full-length transcripts. To utilize the full-length transcripts in defining transcriptome complexity, we devised a method to classify the long reads as the same as existing transcripts or as a novel transcript using sequence mapping tracks rather than existing intron/exon structures, which allowed us to identify roughly 57,000 novel isoforms and recover at least 26,000 out of the 33,500 existing isoforms. The sets of genes with differential expression versus differential isoform usage over development are largely different, implying a fine-tuned regulation at isoform level. We also observed an unexpected increase in putative RNA modification in all bases in the coding region relative to the UTR, suggesting their possible roles in translation. The RNA reads and the method for read classification are expected to deliver new insights into RNA processing and modification and their underlying biology in the future.</p></div>

This step is achieved through the internalization of specified cells from the outermost surface layer, through a process called gastrulation. In <I>Drosophila</I>, gastrulation is achieved through cell shape changes (<I>i.e.</I>, apical constriction) that change tissue curvature and lead to the folding of a surface epithelium. Folding of embryonic tissue results in mesoderm and endoderm invagination, not as individual cells, but as collective tissue units. The tractability of <I>Drosophila</I> as a model system is best exemplified by how much we know about <I>Drosophila</I> gastrulation, from the signals that pattern the embryo to the molecular components that generate force, and how these components are organized to promote cell and tissue shape changes. For mesoderm invagination, graded signaling by the morphogen, Spa&#x0308;tzle, sets up a gradient in transcriptional activity that leads to the expression of a secreted ligand (Folded gastrulation) and a transmembrane protein (T48). Together with the GPCR Mist, which is expressed in the mesoderm, and the GPCR Smog, which is expressed uniformly, these signals activate heterotrimeric G-protein and small Rho-family G-protein signaling to promote apical contractility and changes in cell and tissue shape. A notable feature of this signaling pathway is its intricate organization in both space and time. At the cellular level, signaling components and the cytoskeleton exhibit striking polarity, not only along the apical&ndash;basal cell axis, but also within the apical domain. Furthermore, gene expression controls a highly choreographed chain of events, the dynamics of which are critical for primordium invagination; it does not simply throw the cytoskeletal "on" switch. Finally, studies of <I>Drosophila</I> gastrulation have provided insight into how global tissue mechanics and movements are intertwined as multiple tissues simultaneously change shape. Overall, these studies have contributed to the view that cells respond to forces that propagate over great distances, demonstrating that cellular decisions, and, ultimately, tissue shape changes, proceed by integrating cues across an entire embryo.</p></div>

Nevertheless, <I>structural</I> variations such as copy-number variants (CNVs) represent a large part of natural genetic diversity, and contribute significantly to trait variation. Numerous methods and softwares based on different technologies (amplicons, CGH, tiling, or SNP arrays, or sequencing) have already been developed to detect CNVs, but they bypass a wealth of information such as genotyping data from segregating populations, produced, <I>e.g.</I>, for QTL mapping. Here, we propose an original method to both detect and <I>genetically map</I> CNVs using mapping panels. Specifically, we exploit the apparent heterozygous state of duplicated loci: peaks in appropriately defined genome-wide allelic profiles provide highly specific signatures that identify the nature and position of the CNVs. Our original method and software can detect and map automatically up to 33 different predefined types of CNVs based on segregation data only. We validate this approach on simulated and experimental biparental mapping panels in two maize populations and one wheat population. Most of the events found correspond to having just one extra copy in one of the parental lines, but the corresponding allelic value can be that of either parent. We also find cases with two or more additional copies, especially in wheat, where these copies locate to homeologues. More generally, our computational tool can be used to give additional value, at no cost, to many datasets produced over the past decade from genetic mapping panels.</p></div>

The nematode <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is a useful model for studying the genetics of both behaviors. However, most methods of measuring feeding in worms quantify either foraging behavior or food intake, but not both.

Here, we used a bioluminescent <I>Escherichia coli</I> strain to quantify <I>C. elegans</I> feeding. With light emission tightly coupled to active metabolism, only living bacteria are capable of bioluminescence, so the signal is lost upon ingestion. We quantified the loss of bioluminescence using N2 reference worms and <A HREF="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00001133?doi=10.1534/genetics.119.302804"><I>eat-2</I></inter-ref> mutants, and found a nearly 100-fold increase in signal-to-background ratio and lower background compared to loss of fluorescence.

In <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>, ribosomal RNAs are transcribed from rDNA located on the right arm of chromosome&nbsp;XII. Numerous studies reveal that rDNA decondenses into a puff-like structure during interphase, and condenses into a tight loop-like structure during mitosis. Intriguingly, a novel and additional mechanism of increased mitotic rDNA compaction (termed hypercondensation) was recently discovered that occurs in response to temperature stress (hyperthermic-induced) and is rapidly reversible. Here, we report that neither changes in condensin binding or release of DNA during mitosis, nor mutation of factors that regulate cohesin binding and release, appear to play a critical role in hyperthermic-induced rDNA hypercondensation. A candidate genetic approach revealed that deletion of either <A HREF="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/SGD:S000006161?doi=10.1534/genetics.119.302994"><I>HSP82</I></inter-ref> or <inter-ref locator="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/SGD:S000004798?doi=10.1534/genetics.119.302994" locator-type="url"><I>HSC82</I></inter-ref> (Hsp90 encoding heat shock paralogs) result in significantly reduced hyperthermic-induced rDNA hypercondensation.

During meiosis I, homologs pair and remain conjoined until segregation at anaphase. <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> spermatocytes are unique in that the canonical events of meiosis I including synaptonemal complex formation, double-strand DNA breaks, and chiasmata are absent. Sex chromosomes pair at intergenic spacer sequences within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Autosomes pair at numerous euchromatic homologies, but not at heterochromatin, suggesting that pairing may be limited to specific sequences. However, previous work generated from genetic segregation assays or observations of late prophase I/prometaphase I chromosome associations fail to differentiate pairing from maintenance of pairing (conjunction). Here, we separately examined the capability of X euchromatin to pair and conjoin using an rDNA-deficient X and a series of <I>Dp</I><I>(1;Y)</I> chromosomes. Genetic assays showed that duplicated X euchromatin can substitute for endogenous rDNA pairing sites. Segregation was not proportional to homology length, and pairing could be mapped to nonoverlapping sequences within a single <I>Dp</I><I>(1;Y)</I>. Using fluorescence <I>in situ</I> hybridization to early prophase I spermatocytes, we showed that pairing occurred with high fidelity at all homologies tested. Pairing was unaffected by the presence of X rDNA, nor could it be explained by rDNA magnification. By comparing genetic and cytological data, we determined that centromere proximal pairings were best at segregation. Segregation was dependent on the conjunction protein Stromalin in Meiosis, while the autosomal-specific Teflon was dispensable. Overall, our results suggest that pairing may occur at all homologies, but there may be sequence or positional requirements for conjunction.</p></div>

A second mutant showed the same W-linked inheritance pattern, with a female heterozygote passing the mutation only to daughters.

However, the frequency and magnitude of these effects remain debated. To determine how changes in chromosome positioning affect transcription across thousands of genes with minimal perturbation, we characterized nuclear organization and global gene expression in budding yeast containing chromosome fusions. We used computational modeling and single-cell imaging to determine chromosome positions, and integrated these data with genome-wide transcriptional profiles from RNA sequencing. We find that chromosome fusions dramatically alter 3D nuclear organization without leading to strong genome-wide changes in transcription. However, we observe a mild but significant and reproducible increase in the expression of genes displaced away from the periphery. The increase in transcription is inversely proportional to the propensity of a given locus to be at the nuclear periphery; for example, a 10% decrease in the propensity of a gene to reside at the nuclear envelope is accompanied by a 10% increase in gene expression. Modeling suggests that this is due to both deletion of telomeres and to displacement of genes relative to the nuclear periphery. These data suggest that basal transcriptional activity is sensitive to radial changes in gene position, and provide insight into the functional relevance of budding yeast chromosome-level 3D organization in gene expression.</p></div>

Mitochondrial uniparental inheritance (mito-UPI) could be beneficial in that it avoids possible genetic conflicts between organelles with different genetic backgrounds, as recently shown in mice, and it could prevent the spread of selfish genetic elements in the mitochondrial genome. Despite the prevalence of observed mito-UPI, the underlying mechanisms and the genes involved in controlling this non-Mendelian inheritance are poorly understood in many species. In <I>Cryptococcus neoformans</I>, a human pathogenic basidiomyceteous fungus, mating types (<I>MAT</I>&alpha; and <I>MAT</I><b>a</b>) are defined by alternate alleles at the single <I>MAT</I> locus that evolved from fusion of the two <I>MAT</I> loci (<I>P/R</I> encoding pheromones and pheromone receptors, and <I>HD</I> encoding homeodomain transcription factors) that are the ancestral state in the basidiomycota. Mitochondria are inherited uniparentally from the <I>MAT</I><b>a</b> parent in <I>C. neoformans</I>, and this requires the <I>SXI1</I>&alpha; and <I>SXI2</I><b>a</b> HD factors encoded by <I>MAT</I>.

Consistently, by replacing the <I>MAT</I>&alpha; alleles of the pheromones (<I>MF</I>) and pheromone receptor (<I>STE3</I>) with the <I>MAT</I><b>a</b> alleles, we show that these <I>P/R</I> locus-defining genes indeed affect mito-UPI in <I>C. neoformans</I> during sexual reproduction. Additionally, we show that during early stages of <I>C. neoformans</I> sexual reproduction, conjugation tubes are always produced by the <I>MAT</I>&alpha; cells, resulting in unidirectional migration of the <I>MAT</I>&alpha; nucleus into the <I>MAT</I><b>a</b> cell during zygote formation. This process is controlled by the <I>P/R</I> locus and could serve to physically restrict movement of <I>MAT</I>&alpha; mitochondria in the zygotes, and thereby contribute to mito-UPI. We propose a model in which both physical and genetic mechanisms function in concert to prevent the coexistence of mitochondria from the two parents in the zygote, and subsequently in the meiotic progeny, thus ensuring mito-UPI in pathogenic <I>Cryptococcus</I>, as well as in closely related nonpathogenic species. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the evolution of mito-UPI in fungi and other more diverse eukaryotes.</p></div>

We selected a human&ndash;yeast pair (h<I>FEN1</I>/y<A HREF="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/SGD:S000001596?doi=10.1534/genetics.119.302971"><I>RAD27</I></inter-ref>), which is frequently overexpressed in cancer and is an anticancer therapeutic target, to perform <I>in vivo</I> inhibitor assays using a humanized yeast cell-based platform.

Oxidative phosphorylation produces ATP, but it is also a central high-capacity electron sink required by many metabolic pathways that must be flexibly coordinated and integrated. Here, we review the crucial roles of redox-associated posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs) in mitochondrial metabolic regulation. We discuss several major concepts. First, the major redox couples in the mitochondrial matrix (NAD, NADP, thioredoxin, glutathione, and ascorbate) are in kinetic steady state rather than thermodynamic equilibrium. Second, targeted proteomics have produced long lists of proteins potentially regulated by Cys oxidation/thioredoxin, Met-SO formation, phosphorylation, or Lys acetylation, but we currently only understand the functional importance of a few of these PTMs. Some site modifications may represent molecular noise caused by spurious reactions. Third, different PTMs on the same protein or on different proteins in the same metabolic pathway can interact to fine-tune metabolic regulation. Fourth, PTMs take part in the repair of stress-induced damage (e.g., by reducing Met and Cys oxidation products) as well as adjusting metabolic functions in response to environmental variation, such as changes in light irradiance or oxygen availability. Finally, PTMs form a multidimensional regulatory system that provides the speed and flexibility needed for mitochondrial coordination far beyond that provided by changes in nuclear gene expression alone.</p></div>

In plants, intercellular communication is largely dependent on plasmodesmata (PD), which are membrane-lined channels connecting adjacent plant cells. Upon immune stimulation, plants close PD as part of their immune responses. Here, we show that the bacterial pathogen <I>Pseudomonas syringae</I> deploys an effector protein, HopO1-1, that modulates PD function. HopO1-1 is required for <I>P. syringae</I> to spread locally to neighboring tissues during infection. Expression of HopO1-1 in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>) increases the distance of PD-dependent molecular flux between neighboring plant cells. Being a putative ribosyltransferase, the catalytic activity of HopO1-1 is required for regulation of PD. HopO1-1 physically interacts with and destabilizes the plant PD-located protein PDLP7 and possibly PDLP5. Both PDLPs are involved in bacterial immunity. Our findings reveal that a pathogenic bacterium utilizes an effector to manipulate PD-mediated host intercellular communication for maximizing the spread of bacterial infection.</p></div>

Previous studies have suggested functional interplay of SA and ET in defense responses, but precisely how these two hormones coregulate plant growth and development processes remains unclear. Our present work reveals antagonism between SA and ET in apical hook formation, which ensures successful soil emergence of etiolated dicotyledonous seedlings. Exogenous SA inhibited ET-induced expression of <I>HOOKLESS1</I> (<I>HLS1</I>) in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>) in a manner dependent on ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1), the core transcription factors in the ET signaling pathway. SA-activated NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES1 (NPR1) physically interacted with EIN3 and interfered with the binding of EIN3 to target gene promoters, including the <I>HLS1</I> promoter. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NPR1 and EIN3/EIL1 coordinately regulated subsets of genes that mediate plant growth and stress responses, suggesting that the interaction between NPR1 and EIN3/EIL1 is an important mechanism for integrating the SA and ET signaling pathways in multiple physiological processes. Taken together, our findings illuminate the molecular mechanism underlying SA regulation of apical hook formation as well as the antagonism between SA and ET in early seedling establishment and possibly other physiological processes.</p></div>

Here, we show that the rice (<I>Oryza sativa</I>) NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) transcription factor ONAC054 plays an important role in ABA-induced leaf senescence. The <I>onac054</I> knockout mutants maintained green leaves, while <I>ONAC054</I>-overexpressing lines showed early leaf yellowing under dark- and ABA-induced senescence conditions. Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including <I>ABA INSENSITIVE5</I> (<I>OsABI5</I>) and senescence-associated genes, including <I>STAY-GREEN</I> and <I>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</I> (<I>NYC1</I>), were significantly down-regulated in <I>onac054</I> mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays showed that ONAC054 directly activates <I>OsABI5</I> and <I>NYC1</I> by binding to the mitochondrial dysfunction motif in their promoters. ONAC054 activity is regulated by proteolytic processing of the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). We found that nuclear import of ONAC054 requires cleavage of the putative C-terminal TMD. Furthermore, the <I>ONAC054</I> transcript (termed <I>ONAC054&alpha;</I>) has an alternatively spliced form (<I>ONAC054&beta;</I>), with seven nucleotides inserted between intron 5 and exon 6, truncating ONAC054&alpha; protein at a premature stop codon. ONAC054&beta; lacks the TMD and thus localizes to the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that the activity of ONAC054, which is important for ABA-induced leaf senescence in rice, is precisely controlled by multilayered regulatory processes.</p></div>

Centromere repositioning and evolutionary new centromeres (ENCs) were frequently encountered during vertebrate genome evolution but only rarely observed in plants. The largest crucifer tribe, Arabideae (~550 species; Brassicaceae, the mustard family), diversified into several well-defined subclades in the virtual absence of chromosome number variation. Bacterial artificial chromosome&ndash;based comparative chromosome painting uncovered a constancy of genome structures among 10 analyzed genomes representing seven Arabideae subclades classified as four genera: <I>Arabis</I>, <I>Aubrieta</I>, <I>Draba</I>, and <I>Pseudoturritis</I>. Interestingly, the intra-tribal diversification was marked by a high frequency of ENCs on five of the eight homoeologous chromosomes in the crown-group genera, but not in the most ancestral <I>Pseudoturritis</I> genome. From the 32 documented ENCs, at least 26 originated independently, including 4 ENCs recurrently formed at the same position in not closely related species. While chromosomal localization of ENCs does not reflect the phylogenetic position of the Arabideae subclades, centromere seeding was usually confined to long chromosome arms, transforming acrocentric chromosomes to (sub)metacentric chromosomes. Centromere repositioning is proposed as the key mechanism differentiating overall conserved homoeologous chromosomes across the crown-group Arabideae subclades. The evolutionary significance of centromere repositioning is discussed in the context of possible adaptive effects on recombination and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.</p></div>

Multi-hour R<SUB>N</SUB> measurements following leaf disc exposure to a wide array of primary carbon metabolites (carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids) identified phospho<I>enol</I>pyruvate (PEP), Pro, and Ala as the most potent stimulators of plant leaf R<SUB>N</SUB>.

The inhibitory effects of amino acids on Pro- and Ala-stimulated R<SUB>N</SUB> were mitigated by inhibition of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase signaling pathway.

However, the mitotic function of both kinesins has yet to be determined in plants. Here, we generated complete null mutants of <I>Kinesin-13</I> and <I>Kinesin-8</I> in moss (<I>Physcomitrella patens</I>). Both kinesins were found to be nonessential for viability, but the <I>Kinesin-13</I> knockout (KO) line had increased mitotic duration and reduced spindle length, whereas the <I>Kinesin-8</I> KO line did not display obvious mitotic defects. Surprisingly, spindle MT poleward flux, which is mediated by Kinesin-13 in animals, was retained in the absence of Kinesin-13. MT depolymerase activity was not detectable for either kinesin in vitro, while MT catastrophe-inducing activity (Kinesin-13) or MT gliding activity (Kinesin-8) was observed. Interestingly, both KO lines showed waviness in their protonema filaments, which correlated with positional instability of the MT foci in their tip cells. Taken together, the results suggest that plant Kinesin-13 and Kinesin-8 have diverged in both mitotic function and molecular activity, acquiring roles in regulating MT foci positioning for directed tip growth.</p></div>

In pseudouridine, C5 of uracil is attached to the Rib via an unusual C-glycosidic bond. This RNA modification is introduced on the RNA by site-specific transglycosylation of uridine (U), a process mediated by pseudouridine synthases. RNA is subject to constant turnover, releasing free pseudouridine, but the metabolic fate of pseudouridine in eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>), pseudouridine is catabolized in the peroxisome by (1) a pseudouridine kinase (PUKI) from the PfkB family that generates 5'-pseudouridine monophosphate (5'-MP) and (2) a MP glycosylase (PUMY) that hydrolyzes MP to uracil and ribose-5-phosphate. Compromising pseudouridine catabolism leads to strong pseudouridine accumulation and increased MP content. MP is toxic, causing delayed germination and growth inhibition, but compromising pseudouridine catabolism does not affect the /U ratios in RNA. The bipartite peroxisomal PUKI and PUMY are conserved in plants and algae, whereas some fungi and most animals (except mammals) possess a PUMY-PUKI fusion protein, likely in mitochondria. We propose that vacuolar turnover of ribosomal RNA produces most of the pseudouridine pool via 3'-MP, which is imported through the cytosol into the peroxisomes for degradation by PUKI and PUMY, a process involving a toxic 5'-MP intermediate.</p></div>

We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517. Rice plants overexpressing <I>OsPP95</I> reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, Pi levels were lower in young leaves and higher in old leaves in <I>ospp95</I> mutants than in those of the wild type, even though the overall shoot Pi levels were the same in the mutant and the wild type. In the wild type, OsPP95 accumulated under Pi starvation but was rapidly degraded under Pi-sufficient conditions. We show that OsPHO2 interacts with and induces the degradation of OsPP95. We conclude that OsPP95, a protein phosphatase negatively regulated by OsPHO2, positively regulates Pi homeostasis and remobilization by dephosphorylating PTs and affecting their trafficking to the PM, a reversible process required for adaptation to variable Pi conditions.</p></div>

Here we present a technique for the affinity purification of plant mitochondria (Mito-AP). The stable ectopic expression of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein fused to a GFP:Strep tag in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>) exclusively decorates mitochondria, enabling their selective affinity purification using magnetic beads coated with Strep-Tactin. With Mito-AP, intact mitochondria from 0.5 g plant material were highly enriched in 30&ndash;60 min, considerably faster than with conventional gradient centrifugation. Combining gradient centrifugation and Mito-AP techniques resulted in high purity of &gt;90% mitochondrial proteins in the lysate. Mito-AP supports mitochondrial proteome analysis by shotgun proteomics. The relative abundances of proteins from distinct mitochondrial isolation methods were correlated. A cluster of 619 proteins was consistently enriched by all methods. Among these were several proteins that lack subcellular localization data or that are currently assigned to other compartments. Mito-AP is also compatible with mitochondrial metabolome analysis by triple-quadrupole and orbitrap mass spectrometry. Mito-AP preparations showed a strong enrichment with typical mitochondrial lipids like cardiolipins and demonstrated the presence of several ubiquinones in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Affinity purification of organelles is a powerful tool for reaching higher spatial and temporal resolution for the analysis of metabolomic and proteomic dynamics within subcellular compartments. Mito-AP is small scale, rapid, economic, and potentially applicable to any organelle or to organelle subpopulations.</p></div>

Alkanes are common components of these waxes, and their abundance is affected by a range of stresses. The CER16 protein has been implicated in alkane biosynthesis in the cuticular wax of Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>). Here, we identified two new mutant alleles of <I>CER16</I> in Arabidopsis resulting in production of less wax with dramatically fewer alkanes than the wild type.

To define the relationship between CER3 and CER16, we transformed the full <I>CER3</I> gene into a <I>cer16</I> mutant.

In comparison with their bacterial and mitochondrial counterparts, the biogenesis of plastid ribosomes is less well understood, and few auxiliary factors have been described so far. In this study, we report the functional characterization of CONSERVED ONLY IN THE GREEN LINEAGE20 (CGL20) in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>; AtCGL20), which is a Pro-rich, ~10-kD protein that is targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts. In Arabidopsis, CGL20 is encoded by segmentally duplicated genes of high sequence similarity (<I>AtCGL20A</I> and <I>AtCGL20B</I>). Inactivation of these genes in the <I>atcgl20ab</I> mutant led to a visible virescent phenotype and growth arrest at low temperature. The chloroplast proteome, pigment composition, and photosynthetic performance were significantly affected in <I>atcgl20ab</I> mutants. Loss of AtCGL20 impaired plastid translation, perturbing the formation of a hidden break in the 23S rRNA and causing abnormal accumulation of 50S ribosomal subunits in the high-molecular-mass fraction of chloroplast stromal extracts. Moreover, AtCGL20A-eGFP fusion proteins comigrated with 50S ribosomal subunits in Suc density gradients, even after RNase treatment of stromal extracts. Therefore, we propose that AtCGL20 participates in the late stages of the biogenesis of 50S ribosomal subunits in plastids, a role that presumably evolved in the green lineage as a consequence of structural divergence of plastid ribosomes.</p></div>

Thus, the chloroplast is of utmost importance for cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. During cold acclimation, the properties of the chloroplast change markedly. To provide the most comprehensive view of the protein repertoire of the chloroplast envelope, we analyzed this membrane system in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>) using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Profiling chloroplast envelope membranes was achieved by a cross comparison of protein intensities across the plastid and the enriched membrane fraction under both normal and cold conditions. We used multivariable logistic regression to model the probabilities for the classification of an envelope localization. In total, we identified 38 envelope membrane intrinsic or associated proteins exhibiting altered abundance after cold acclimation. These proteins comprise several solute carriers, such as the ATP/ADP antiporter nucleotide transporter2 (NTT2; substantially increased abundance) or the maltose exporter MEX1 (substantially decreased abundance). Remarkably, analysis of the frost recovery of <I>ntt</I> loss-of-function and <I>mex1</I> overexpressor mutants confirmed that the comparative proteome is well suited to identify key factors involved in cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. Moreover, for proteins with known physiological function, we propose scenarios explaining their possible roles in cold acclimation. Furthermore, spatial proteomics introduces an additional layer of complexity and enables the identification of proteins differentially localized at the envelope membrane under the changing environmental regime.</p></div>

In this study we demonstrate that in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>), two distinctly localized acetate-activating enzymes, ACETYL-COA SYNTHETASE (ACS) in plastids and ACETATE NON-UTILIZING1 (ACN1) in peroxisomes, function redundantly to prevent the accumulation of excess acetate. In contrast to the near wild-type morphological and metabolic phenotypes of <I>acs</I> or <I>acn1</I> mutants, the <I>acs acn1</I> double mutant is delayed in growth and sterile, which is associated with hyperaccumulation of cellular acetate and decreased accumulation of acetyl-CoA-derived intermediates of central metabolism. Using multiple mutant stocks and stable isotope-assisted metabolic analyses, we demonstrate the twin metabolic origins of acetate from the oxidation of ethanol and the nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, with acetaldehyde being the common intermediate precursor of acetate. Conversion from pyruvate to acetate is activated under hypoxic conditions, and ACS recovers carbon that would otherwise be lost from the plant as ethanol. Plastid-localized ACS metabolizes cellular acetate and contributes to the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids and Leu; peroxisome-localized ACN1 enables the incorporation of acetate into organic acids and amino acids. Thus, the activation of acetate in distinct subcellular compartments provides plants with the metabolic flexibility to maintain physiological levels of acetate and a metabolic mechanism for the recovery of carbon that would otherwise be lost as ethanol, for example following hypoxia.</p></div>

Accordingly, Zn deficiency (&ndash;Zn) in agricultural fields is a serious problem, especially in developing regions. Autophagy, a major intracellular degradation system in eukaryotes, plays important roles in nutrient recycling under nitrogen and carbon starvation. However, the relationship between autophagy and deficiencies of other essential elements remains poorly understood, especially in plants. In this study, we focused on Zn due to the property that within cells most Zn is tightly bound to proteins, which can be targets of autophagy. We found that autophagy plays a critical role during &ndash;Zn in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>). Autophagy-defective plants (<I>atg</I> mutants) failed to grow and developed accelerated chlorosis under &ndash;Zn. As expected, &ndash;Zn induced autophagy in wild-type plants, whereas in <I>atg</I> mutants, various organelle proteins accumulated to high levels. Additionally, the amount of free Zn<sup>2+</sup> was lower in <I>atg</I> mutants than in control plants. Interestingly, &ndash;Zn symptoms in <I>atg</I> mutants recovered under low-light, iron-limited conditions. The levels of hydroxyl radicals in chloroplasts were elevated, and the levels of superoxide were reduced in &ndash;Zn <I>atg</I> mutants. These results imply that the photosynthesis-mediated Fenton-like reaction, which is responsible for the chlorotic symptom of &ndash;Zn, is accelerated in <I>atg</I> mutants.

The subcellular localization of enzymes that catalyze allantoin synthesis and degradation indicates that allantoin is produced in peroxisomes and degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it has been determined that allantoin is mostly synthesized in roots and transported to shoots either for organic nitrogen translocation in legumes or for plant protection during stress in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>), the mechanism and molecular components of allantoin export from root cells are still unknown. AtUPS5 (Arabidopsis UREIDE PERMEASE 5) is a transmembrane protein that transports allantoin with high affinity when expressed in yeast. The subcellular fate of splicing variants AtUPS5L (long) and AtUPS5S (short) was studied by tagging them with fluorescent proteins in their cytosolic loops. The capability of these fusion proteins to complement the function of the native proteins was demonstrated by nutritional and salt stress experiments. Both variants localized to the ER, but the AtUPS5L variant was also detected in the trans-Golgi network/early endosome and at the plasma membrane. AtUPS5L and AtUPS5S localization indicates that they could have different roles in allantoin distribution between subcellular compartments. Our data suggest that under nonstress conditions UPS5L and UPS5S may function in allantoin degradation for nutrient recycling, whereas under stress, both genes may be involved in vesicular export allowing allantoin translocation from roots to shoots.</p></div>

Of particular interest is the switch from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic seedling growth, for which cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) play a critical role as depots for energy-rich storage lipids. Here, we present the results of a bottom-up proteomics study analyzing the total protein fractions and LD-enriched fractions in eight different developmental phases during silique (seed) development, seed germination, and seedling establishment in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>). The quantitative analysis of the LD proteome using LD-enrichment factors led to the identification of six previously unidentified and comparably low-abundance LD proteins, each of which was confirmed by intracellular localization studies with fluorescent protein fusions. In addition to these advances in LD protein discovery and the potential insights provided to as yet unexplored aspects in plant LD functions, our data set allowed for a comparative analysis of the LD protein composition throughout the various developmental phases examined. Among the most notable of the alterations in the LD proteome were those during seedling establishment, indicating a switch in the physiological function(s) of LDs after greening of the cotyledons.

We also retrieved publicly available soybean transcriptome data that were of sufficient quality and sequencing depth to enrich our analysis. In total, RNA-sequencing data of 332 samples were used for this analysis. An integrated reference-based, de novo transcript assembly was developed that identified ~69,000 lncRNA gene loci. We showed that lncRNAs are distinct from both protein-coding transcripts and genomic background noise in terms of length, number of exons, transposable element composition, and sequence conservation level across legume species. The tissue-specific and time-specific transcriptional responses of the lncRNA genes under some stress conditions may suggest their biological relevance. The transcription start sites of lncRNA gene loci tend to be close to their nearest protein-coding genes, and they may be transcriptionally related to the protein-coding genes, particularly for antisense and intronic lncRNAs. A previously unreported subset of small peptide-coding transcripts was identified from these lncRNA loci via tandem mass spectrometry, which paved the way for investigating their functional roles. Our results also highlight the present inadequacy of the bioinformatic definition of lncRNA, which excludes those lncRNA gene loci with small open reading frames from being regarded as protein-coding.</p></div>

How the high-temperature signal is perceived and transmitted to regulate stomatal aperture is, however, unknown. Here, we used a reverse-genetics approach to understand high temperature-mediated stomatal opening in Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>). Our findings reveal that high temperature-induced guard cell movement requires components involved in blue light-mediated stomatal opening, suggesting cross talk between light and temperature signaling pathways. The molecular players involved include phototropin photoreceptors, plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, and multiple members of the 14-3-3 protein family. We further show that phototropin-deficient mutants display impaired rosette evapotranspiration and leaf cooling at high temperatures. Blocking the interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with their client proteins severely impairs high temperature-induced stomatal opening but has no effect on the induction of heat-sensitive guard cell transcripts, supporting the existence of an additional intracellular high-temperature response pathway in plants.</p></div>

In Arabidopsis (<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>), FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY&ndash;INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF), regulates root Fe acquisition genes. Many other &ndash;Fe-induced genes are FIT independent, and instead regulated by other bHLH TFs and by yet unknown TFs. The cis-regulatory code, that is, the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their combinations that regulate plant &ndash;Fe-responses, remains largely elusive. Using Arabidopsis root transcriptome data and coexpression clustering, we identified over 100 putative CREs (pCREs) that predicted &ndash;Fe-induced gene expression in computational models. To assess pCRE properties and possible functions, we used large-scale in vitro TF binding data, positional bias, and evolutionary conservation. As one example, our approach uncovered pCREs resembling IDE1 (iron deficiency-responsive element 1), a known grass &ndash;Fe response CRE. Arabidopsis IDE1-likes were associated with FIT-dependent gene expression, more specifically with biosynthesis of Fe-chelating compounds. Thus, IDE1 seems to be conserved in grass and nongrass species. Our pCREs matched among others in vitro binding sites of B3, NAC, bZIP, and TCP TFs, which might be regulators of &ndash;Fe responses. Altogether, our findings provide a comprehensive source of cis-regulatory information for &ndash;Fe-responsive genes that advance our mechanistic understanding and inform future efforts in engineering plants with more efficient Fe uptake or transport systems.</p></div>

However, the components and regulatory factors governing nitrate uptake in bread wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I>), one of the world&rsquo;s most important crop species, have remained unclear, largely due to the complexity of its hexaploid genome. Here, based on recently released whole-genome information for bread wheat, the high-affinity nitrate transporter2 (<I>NRT2</I>) and the nitrate-assimilation-related (<I>NAR</I>) gene family are characterized. We show that abscisic acid (ABA)- Glc ester deconjugation is stimulated in bread wheat roots by nitrate resupply following nitrate withdrawal, leading to enhanced root-tissue ABA accumulation, and that this enhancement, in turn, affects the expression of root-type <I>NRT2</I>/<I>NAR</I> genes.

Plant-available P is low in most soils, making it a frequent limiter of growth. Declining P reserves for fertilizer production exacerbates this agricultural challenge. Plants modulate complex responses to fluctuating P levels via global transcriptional regulatory networks. Although chromatin structure plays a substantial role in controlling gene expression, the chromatin dynamics involved in regulating P homeostasis have not been determined. Here we define distinct chromatin states across the rice (<I>Oryza sativa</I>) genome by integrating multiple chromatin marks, including the H2A.Z histone variant, H3K4me3 modification, and nucleosome positioning. In response to P starvation, 40% of all protein-coding genes exhibit a transition from one chromatin state to another at their transcription start site. Several of these transitions are enriched in subsets of genes differentially expressed under P deficiency. The most prominent subset supports the presence of a coordinated signaling network that targets cell wall structure and is regulated in part via a decrease of H3K4me3 at transcription start sites. The P starvation-induced chromatin dynamics and correlated genes identified here will aid in enhancing P use efficiency in crop plants, benefitting global agriculture.</p></div>

In this study, we applied single-molecule long-read RNA sequencing (lrRNA_seq)-based proteogenomics to reveal the complexity of the rice transcriptome and its coding abilities. Surprisingly, approximately 60% of loci identified by lrRNA_seq are associated with natural antisense transcripts (NATs). The high-density genomic arrangement of NAT genes suggests their potential roles in the multifaceted control of gene expression. In addition, a large number of fusion and intergenic transcripts have been observed. Furthermore, 906,456 transcript isoforms were identified, and 72.9% of the genes can generate splicing isoforms. A total of 706,075 posttranscriptional events were subsequently categorized into 10 subtypes, demonstrating the interdependence of posttranscriptional mechanisms that contribute to transcriptome diversity. Parallel short-read RNA sequencing indicated that lrRNA_seq has a superior capacity for the identification of longer transcripts. In addition, over 190,000 unique peptides belonging to 9,706 proteoforms/protein groups were identified, expanding the diversity of the rice proteome.

Genome-scale experiments for miRNA target site detection are still costly. The prediction accuracies of existing computational algorithms and tools are often not up to the expectation due to a large number of false positives. One major obstacle to achieve a higher accuracy is the lack of knowledge of the target binding features of miRNAs. The published high-throughput experimental data provide an opportunity to analyze position-wise preference of miRNAs in terms of target binding, which can be an important feature in miRNA target prediction algorithms.<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>We developed a Markov model to characterize position-wise pairing patterns of miRNA-target interactions. We further integrated this model as a scoring method and developed a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, MDPS (Markov model-scored Dynamic Programming algorithm for miRNA target site Selection) that can screen putative target sites of miRNA-target binding. The MDPS algorithm thus can take into account both the dependency of neighboring pairing positions and the global pairing information. Based on the trained Markov models from both miRNA specific and general datasets, we discovered that the position-wise binding information specific to a given miRNA would benefit its target prediction. We also found that miRNAs maintain region-wise similarity in their target binding patterns. Combining MDPS with existing methods significantly improves their precision while only slightly reduces their recall. Therefore, position-wise pairing patterns have the promise to improve target prediction if incorporated into existing software tools.<div class="boxTitle">Availability</div>The source code and tool to calculate MDPS score is available at <a href="http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/MDPS/index.html">http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/MDPS/index.html</a>.<div class="boxTitle">Supplementary information</div>Supplementary data are available at <span style="font-style:italic;">Bioinformatics</span> online.</span></div>

C. Rocha, David Vallenet</p>The use of comparative genomics for functional, evolutionary, and epidemiological studies requires methods to classify gene families in terms of occurrence in a given species. These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and don’t account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics.

This can result in lower precision and sensitivity in the identification of the more common structural variants such as deletions and duplications. We present SVXplorer, which uses a graph-based clustering approach streamlined by the integration of non-trivial signatures from discordant paired-end alignments, split-reads and read depth information to improve upon existing methods.

In this study, we show that the nycthemeral rhythmicity at the gene expression level is biologically functional and that this functionality is more conserved between orthologous genes than between random genes. We used this conservation of the rhythmic expression to assess the ability of seven methods (ARSER, Lomb Scargle, RAIN, JTK, empirical-JTK, GeneCycle, and meta2d) to detect rhythmic signal in gene expression. We have contrasted them to a naive method, not based on rhythmic parameters. By taking into account the tissue-specificity of rhythmic gene expression and different species comparisons, we show that no method is strongly favored. The results show that these methods designed for rhythm detection, in addition to having quite similar performances, are consistent only among genes with a strong rhythm signal. Rhythmic genes defined with a standard <i>p</i>-value threshold of 0.01 for instance, could include genes whose rhythmicity is biologically irrelevant. Although these results were dependent on the datasets used and the evolutionary distance between the species compared, we call for caution about the results of studies reporting or using large sets of rhythmic genes. Furthermore, given the analysis of the behaviors of the methods on real and randomized data, we recommend using primarily ARS, empJTK, or GeneCycle, which verify expectations of a classical distribution of <i>p</i>-values. Experimental design should also take into account the circumstances under which the methods seem more efficient, such as giving priority to biological replicates over the number of time-points, or to the number of time-points over the quality of the technique (microarray vs RNAseq). GeneCycle, and to a lesser extent empirical-JTK, might be the most robust method when applied to weakly informative datasets. Finally, our analyzes suggest that rhythmic genes are mainly highly expressed genes.</div>

Our knowledge of how to normalize datasets to remove latent undesirable variances has grown extensively, making for standardized data that are easily compared between studies. Here we present the CAncer bioMarker Prediction Pipeline (CAMPP), an open-source R-based wrapper (https://github.com/ELELAB/CAncer-bioMarker-Prediction-Pipeline -CAMPP) intended to aid bioinformatic software-users with data analyses. CAMPP is called from a terminal command line and is supported by a user-friendly manual. The pipeline may be run on a local computer and requires little or no knowledge of programming. To avoid issues relating to R-package updates, a renv .lock file is provided to ensure R-package stability. Data-management includes missing value imputation, data normalization, and distributional checks. CAMPP performs (I) k-means clustering, (II) differential expression/abundance analysis, (III) elastic-net regression, (IV) correlation and co-expression network analyses, (V) survival analysis, and (VI) protein-protein/miRNA-gene interaction networks. The pipeline returns tabular files and graphical representations of the results. We hope that CAMPP will assist in streamlining bioinformatic analysis of quantitative biological data, whilst ensuring an appropriate bio-statistical framework.</div>

However, little is known about how individuals integrate this information to take decisions and control their motion. Here, we combine experiments with computational and robotic approaches to investigate the impact of different strategies for a fish to interact with its neighbors on collective swimming in groups of rummy-nose tetra (<i>Hemigrammus rhodostomus</i>). By means of a data-based agent model describing the interactions between pairs of <i>H. rhodostomus</i> (Calovi <i>et al</i>., 2018), we show that the simple addition of the pairwise interactions with two neighbors quantitatively reproduces the collective behavior observed in groups of five fish. Increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the simulation results. Remarkably, and even without confinement, we find that groups remain cohesive and polarized when each agent interacts with only one of its neighbors: the one that has the strongest contribution to the heading variation of the focal agent, dubbed as the “most influential neighbor”. However, group cohesion is lost when each agent only interacts with its nearest neighbor. We then investigate by means of a robotic platform the collective motion in groups of five robots. Our platform combines the implementation of the fish behavioral model and a control system to deal with real-world physical constraints. A better agreement with experimental results for fish is obtained for groups of robots only interacting with their most influential neighbor, than for robots interacting with one or even two nearest neighbors. Finally, we discuss the biological and cognitive relevance of the notion of “most influential neighbors”. Overall, our results suggest that fish have to acquire only a minimal amount of information about their environment to coordinate their movements when swimming in groups.</div>

Davis, T. Deirdre Hollingsworth, Quentin Caudron, Michael A. Irvine</p>Complex, highly-computational, individual-based models are abundant in epidemiology. For epidemics such as macro-parasitic diseases, detailed modelling of human behaviour and pathogen life-cycle are required in order to produce accurate results. This can often lead to models that are computationally-expensive to analyse and perform model fitting, and often require many simulation runs in order to build up sufficient statistics. Emulation can provide a more computationally-efficient output of the individual-based model, by approximating it using a statistical model. Previous work has used Gaussian processes (GPs) in order to achieve this, but these can not deal with multi-modal, heavy-tailed, or discrete distributions. Here, we introduce the concept of a mixture density network (MDN) in its application in the emulation of epidemiological models. MDNs incorporate both a mixture model and a neural network to provide a flexible tool for emulating a variety of models and outputs. We develop an MDN emulation methodology and demonstrate its use on a number of simple models incorporating both normal, gamma and beta distribution outputs. We then explore its use on the stochastic SIR model to predict the final size distribution and infection dynamics. MDNs have the potential to faithfully reproduce multiple outputs of an individual-based model and allow for rapid analysis from a range of users. As such, an open-access library of the method has been released alongside this manuscript.</div>

Bates, Ozgur E. Akman</p>The circadian clock orchestrates biological processes so that they occur at specific times of the day, thereby facilitating adaptation to diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. In plants, mathematical modelling has been comprehensively integrated with experimental studies to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic regulatory network comprising the clock. However, with an increasing number of circadian genes being discovered, there is a pressing need for methods facilitating the expansion of computational models to incorporate these newly-discovered components. Conventionally, plant clock models have comprised differential equation systems based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, the difficulties associated with modifying interactions using this approach—and the concomitant problem of robustly identifying regulation types—has contributed to a complexity bottleneck, with quantitative fits to experimental data rapidly becoming computationally intractable for models possessing more than ≈50 parameters. Here, we address these issues by constructing the first plant clock models based on the S-System formalism originally developed by Savageau for analysing biochemical networks. We show that despite its relative simplicity, this approach yields clock models with comparable accuracy to the conventional Michaelis-Menten formalism. The S-System formulation also confers several key advantages in terms of model construction and expansion. In particular, it simplifies the inclusion of new interactions, whilst also facilitating the modification of regulation types, thereby making it well-suited to network inference. Furthermore, S-System models mitigate the issue of parameter identifiability. Finally, by applying linear systems theory to the models considered, we provide some justification for the increased use of aggregated protein equations in recent plant clock modelling, replacing the separate cytoplasmic/nuclear protein compartments that were characteristic of the earlier models. We conclude that as well as providing a simplified framework for model development, the S-System formalism also possesses significant potential as a robust modelling method for designing synthetic gene circuits.</div>

However, it has remained unclear whether the specific synaptic connectivities required in these networks can be learnt with local learning rules. Here, we show how to learn the required architecture.

We propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult autistic participants to 24 neurotypical (NT) participants engaging in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the NT participants did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding others' competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the AS group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information regarding opponents’ incentives was available. These two computational phenotypes yield 79% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62% of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding individualized clinical interventions in autism.</div>

Sikazwe, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>Estimation of pathogenic life-history values, for instance the duration a pathogen is retained in an insect vector (i.e., retention period) is of particular importance for understanding plant disease epidemiology. How can we extract values for these epidemiological parameters from conventional small-scale laboratory experiments in which transmission success is measured in relation to durations of vector access to host plants? We provide a solution to this problem by deriving formulae for the empirical curves that these experiments produce, called access period response curves (i.e., transmission success vs access period). We do this by writing simple equations for the fundamental life-cycle components of insect vectors in the laboratory. We then infer values of epidemiological parameters by matching the theoretical and empirical gradients of access period response curves. Using the example of <i>Cassava brown streak virus</i> (CBSV), which has emerged in sub-Saharan Africa and now threatens regional food security, we illustrate the method of matching gradients. We show how applying the method to published data produces a new understanding of CBSV through the inference of retention period, acquisition period and inoculation period parameters. We found that CBSV is retained for a far shorter duration in its insect vector (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i> whitefly) than had previously been assumed. Our results shed light on a number of critical factors that may be responsible for the transition of CBSV from sub- to super-threshold <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> in sub-Saharan Africa. The method is applicable to plant pathogens in general, to supply epidemiological parameter estimates that are crucial for practical management of epidemics and prediction of pandemic risk.</div>

We assessed the use of homology modeling to predict the structures of two therapeutically relevant GPCRs and strategies to improve the performance of virtual screening against modeled binding sites. Homology models of the D<sub>2</sub> dopamine (D<sub>2</sub>R) and serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) were generated based on crystal structures of 16 different GPCRs. Comparison of the homology models to D<sub>2</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R crystal structures showed that accurate predictions could be obtained, but not necessarily using the most closely related template. Assessment of virtual screening performance was based on molecular docking of ligands and decoys. The results demonstrated that several templates and multiple models based on each of these must be evaluated to identify the optimal binding site structure. Models based on aminergic GPCRs displayed ligand enrichment and there was a trend toward improved virtual screening performance with increasing binding site accuracy. The best models even displayed ligand enrichment better than that of the D<sub>2</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R crystal structures. Methods to consider binding site plasticity were explored to further improve predictions. Molecular docking to ensembles of structures did not outperform the best individual binding site models, but could increase the diversity of hits from virtual screens and be advantageous for GPCR targets with few known ligands. Molecular dynamics refinement resulted in moderate improvements of structural accuracy and the virtual screening performance of snapshots was either comparable to or worse than that of the raw homology models. These results provide guidelines for successful application of structure-based ligand discovery using GPCR homology models.</div>

Scharf, Jing Chen</p>Coexistence of bacteriophages, or phages, and their host bacteria plays an important role in maintaining the microbial communities. In natural environments with limited nutrients, motile bacteria can actively migrate towards locations of richer resources. Although phages are not motile themselves, they can infect motile bacterial hosts and spread in space via the hosts. Therefore, in a migrating microbial community coexistence of bacteria and phages implies their co-propagation in space. Here, we combine an experimental approach and mathematical modeling to explore how phages and their motile host bacteria coexist and co-propagate. When lytic phages encountered motile host bacteria in our experimental set up, a sector-shaped lysis zone formed. Our mathematical model indicates that local nutrient depletion and the resulting inhibition of proliferation and motility of bacteria and phages are the key to formation of the observed lysis pattern. The model further reveals the straight radial boundaries in the lysis pattern as a telltale sign for coexistence and co-propagation of bacteria and phages. Emergence of such a pattern, albeit insensitive to extrinsic factors, requires a balance between intrinsic biological properties of phages and bacteria, which likely results from coevolution of phages and bacteria.</div>

Corder, Marcelo U. Ferreira, M. Gabriela M. Gomes</p>The overall malaria burden in the Americas has decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but residual transmission pockets persist across the Amazon Basin, where <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> is the predominant infecting species. Current elimination efforts require a better quantitative understanding of malaria transmission dynamics for planning, monitoring, and evaluating interventions at the community level. This can be achieved with mathematical models that properly account for risk heterogeneity in communities approaching elimination, where few individuals disproportionately contribute to overall malaria prevalence, morbidity, and onwards transmission. Here we analyse demographic information combined with routinely collected malaria morbidity data from the town of Mâncio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. We estimate the proportion of high-risk subjects in the host population by fitting compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) transmission models simultaneously to age-stratified vivax malaria incidence densities and the frequency distribution of <i>P</i>. <i>vivax</i> malaria attacks experienced by each individual over 12 months. Simulations with the best-fitting SIS model indicate that 20% of the hosts contribute 86% of the overall vivax malaria burden. Despite the low overall force of infection typically found in the Amazon, about one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, high-risk individuals gradually develop clinical immunity following repeated infections and eventually constitute a substantial infectious reservoir comprised of asymptomatic parasite carriers that is overlooked by routine surveillance but likely fuels onwards malaria transmission. High-risk individuals therefore represent a priority target for more intensive and effective interventions that may not be readily delivered to the entire community.</div>

Shcherbinin, Vlad A. Belousov, Mikhail Shugay</p>Antigen recognition by T-cells is guided by the T-cell receptor (TCR) heterodimer formed by α and β chains. A huge diversity of TCR sequences should be maintained by the immune system in order to be able to mount an effective response towards foreign pathogens, so, due to cooperative binding of α and β chains to the pathogen, any constraints on chain pairing can have a profound effect on immune repertoire structure, diversity and antigen specificity. By integrating available structural data and paired chain sequencing results we were able to show that there are almost no constraints on pairing in TCRαβ complexes, allowing naive T-cell repertoire to reach the highest possible diversity. Additional analysis reveals that the specific choice of contacting amino acids can still have a profound effect on complex conformation. Moreover, antigen-driven selection can distort the uniform landscape of chain pairing, while small, yet significant, differences in the pairing can be attributed to various specialized T-cell subsets such as MAIT and iNKT T-cells, as well as other TCR sets specific to certain antigens.</div>

Fluorescent platelet concentrations at the wall of a glass chamber are measured using confocal microscopy with flowing human blood containing varying healthy-to-stiff RBC fractions. A decrease is observed in the fluorescent platelet signal at the wall due to the increase of stiffened RBCs in flow, suggesting a decrease of platelet margination due to an increased fraction of stiffened RBCs present in the flow. In order to resolve the influence of stiffened RBCs on platelet concentration at the channel wall, cell-pair and bulk flow simulations are performed. For homogeneous collisions between RBC pairs, a decrease in final displacement after a collision with increasing membrane stiffness is observed. In heterogeneous collisions between healthy and stiff RBC pairs, it is found that the stiffened RBC is displaced most. The influence of RBC deformability on collisions between RBCs and platelets was found to be negligible due to their size and mass difference. For a straight vessel geometry with varying healthy-to-stiff RBC ratios, a decrease was observed in the red blood cell-free layer and platelet margination due to an increase in stiffened RBCs present in flow.</div>

A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources—Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive—to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.</div>

When using calcium imaging, we need to extract summarized information from the raw movie beforehand. Recent studies have used matrix deconvolution for this preprocessing. However, such an approach can neither directly estimate the generative mechanism of spike trains nor use stimulus information that has a strong influence on neural activities. Here, we propose a new deconvolution method for calcium imaging using marked point processes. We consider that the observed movie is generated from a probabilistic model with marked point processes as hidden variables, and we calculate the posterior of these variables using a variational inference approach. Our method can simultaneously estimate various kinds of information, such as cell shape, spike occurrence time, and tuning curve. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data to verify its performance.</div>

Einevoll</p>Most modeling in systems neuroscience has been <i>descriptive</i> where neural representations such as ‘receptive fields’, have been found by statistically correlating neural activity to sensory input. In the traditional physics approach to modelling, hypotheses are represented by <i>mechanistic</i> models based on the underlying building blocks of the system, and candidate models are validated by comparing with experiments. Until now validation of mechanistic cortical network models has been based on comparison with neuronal spikes, found from the high-frequency part of extracellular electrical potentials. In this computational study we investigated to what extent the low-frequency part of the signal, the local field potential (LFP), can be used to validate and infer properties of mechanistic cortical network models. In particular, we asked the question whether the LFP can be used to accurately estimate synaptic connection weights in the underlying network. We considered the thoroughly analysed Brunel network comprising an excitatory and an inhibitory population of recurrently connected integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. This model exhibits a high diversity of spiking network dynamics depending on the values of only three network parameters. The LFP generated by the network was computed using a hybrid scheme where spikes computed from the point-neuron network were replayed on biophysically detailed multicompartmental neurons. We assessed how accurately the three model parameters could be estimated from power spectra of stationary ‘background’ LFP signals by application of convolutional neural nets (CNNs). All network parameters could be very accurately estimated, suggesting that LFPs indeed can be used for network model validation.</div>

Interestingly, EMT is not a binary process but instead proceeds with multiple partial intermediate states. However, the functions of these intermediate states are not fully understood. Here, we focus on a general question about how the number of partial EMT states affects cell transformation. First, by fitting a hidden Markov model of EMT with experimental data, we propose a statistical mechanism for EMT in which many unobservable microstates may exist within one of the observable macrostates. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of intermediate states can accelerate the EMT process and that adding parallel paths or transition layers may accelerate the process even further. Last, a stabilized intermediate state traps cells in one partial EMT state. This work advances our understanding of the dynamics and functions of EMT plasticity during cancer metastasis.</div>

This paper introduces the Beacon Calculus, a process algebra designed to simplify the task of modelling interacting biological components. Its breadth is demonstrated by creating models of DNA replication dynamics, the gene expression dynamics in response to DNA methylation damage, and a multisite phosphorylation switch. The flexibility of these models is shown by adapting the DNA replication model to further include two topics of interest from the literature: cooperative origin firing and replication fork barriers. The Beacon Calculus is supported with the open-source simulator bcs (https://github.com/MBoemo/bcs.git) to allow users to develop and simulate their own models.</div>

The Bayesian approach finds distinct reduced models that fit data equivalently. A variant of this approach that uses Lasso to perform selection at the level of reaction modules is applied to the NF-<i>κ</i>B signaling network to test the necessity of feedback loops for responses to pulsatile and continuous pathway stimulation.

Krauland, John J. Grefenstette, Willem G. van Panhuis, Alessandro Vespignani, John M. Drake, Pejman Rohani</p>Despite medical advances, the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases continue to pose a public health threat. Low-dimensional epidemiological models predict that epidemic transitions are preceded by the phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD). This has raised the possibility of anticipating disease (re-)emergence using CSD-based early-warning signals (EWS), which are statistical moments estimated from time series data. For EWS to be useful at detecting future (re-)emergence, CSD needs to be a generic (model-independent) feature of epidemiological dynamics irrespective of system complexity. Currently, it is unclear whether the predictions of CSD—derived from simple, low-dimensional systems—pertain to real systems, which are high-dimensional. To assess the generality of CSD, we carried out a simulation study of a hierarchy of models, with increasing structural complexity and dimensionality, for a measles-like infectious disease. Our five models included: i) a nonseasonal homogeneous Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, ii) a homogeneous SEIR model with seasonality in transmission, iii) an age-structured SEIR model, iv) a multiplex network-based model (Mplex) and v) an agent-based simulator (FRED). All models were parameterised to have a herd-immunity immunization threshold of around 90% coverage, and underwent a linear decrease in vaccine uptake, from 92% to 70% over 15 years. We found evidence of CSD prior to disease re-emergence in all models. We also evaluated the performance of seven EWS: the autocorrelation, coefficient of variation, index of dispersion, kurtosis, mean, skewness, variance. Performance was scored using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) statistic. The best performing EWS were the mean and variance, with AUC > 0.75 one year before the estimated transition time. These two, along with the autocorrelation and index of dispersion, are promising candidate EWS for detecting disease emergence.</div>

Eldred, Cameron Avelis, Robert J. Johnston Jr, Elijah Roberts</p>Nervous systems are incredibly diverse, with myriad neuronal subtypes defined by gene expression. How binary and graded fate characteristics are patterned across tissues is poorly understood. Expression of opsin photopigments in the cone photoreceptors of the mouse retina provides an excellent model to address this question. Individual cones express S-opsin only, M-opsin only, or both S-opsin and M-opsin. These cell populations are patterned along the dorsal-ventral axis, with greater M-opsin expression in the dorsal region and greater S-opsin expression in the ventral region. Thyroid hormone signaling plays a critical role in activating M-opsin and repressing S-opsin. Here, we developed an image analysis approach to identify individual cone cells and evaluate their opsin expression from immunofluorescence imaging tiles spanning roughly 6 mm along the D-V axis of the mouse retina. From analyzing the opsin expression of ~250,000 cells, we found that cones make a binary decision between S-opsin only and co-expression competent fates. Co-expression competent cells express graded levels of S- and M-opsins, depending nonlinearly on their position in the dorsal-ventral axis. M- and S-opsin expression display differential, inverse patterns. Using these single-cell data, we developed a quantitative, probabilistic model of cone cell decisions in the retinal tissue based on thyroid hormone signaling activity. The model recovers the probability distribution for cone fate patterning in the mouse retina and describes a minimal set of interactions that are necessary to reproduce the observed cell fates. Our study provides a paradigm describing how differential responses to regulatory inputs generate complex patterns of binary and graded cell fates.</div>

The uniaxial force produced by sarcomeres is ideally perpendicular to their z-lines, which couple parallel myofibrils and give cardiac and skeletal myocytes their distinct striated appearance. Accordingly, sarcomere structure is often evaluated by staining for z-line proteins such as <i>α</i>-actinin. However, due to limitations of current analysis methods, which require manual or semi-manual handling of images, the mechanism by which sarcomere and by extension z-line architecture can impact contraction and which characteristics of z-line architecture should be used to assess striated myocytes has not been fully explored. Challenges such as isolating z-lines from regions of off-target staining that occur along immature stress fibers and cell boundaries and choosing metrics to summarize overall z-line architecture have gone largely unaddressed in previous work. While an expert can qualitatively appraise tissues, these challenges leave researchers without robust, repeatable tools to assess z-line architecture across different labs and experiments. Additionally, the criteria used by experts to evaluate sarcomeric architecture have not been well-defined. We address these challenges by providing metrics that summarize different aspects of z-line architecture that correspond to expert tissue quality assessment and demonstrate their efficacy through an examination of engineered tissues and single cells. In doing so, we have elucidated a mechanism by which highly elongated cardiomyocytes become inefficient at producing force. Unlike previous manual or semi-manual methods, characterization of z-line architecture using the metrics discussed and implemented in this work can quantitatively evaluate engineered tissues and contribute to a robust understanding of the development and mechanics of striated muscles.</div>

Bernasek, Nicolás Peláez, Richard W. Carthew, Neda Bagheri, Luís A. N. Amaral</p>Mosaic analysis provides a means to probe developmental processes in situ by generating loss-of-function mutants within otherwise wildtype tissues. Combining these techniques with quantitative microscopy enables researchers to rigorously compare RNA or protein expression across the resultant clones. However, visual inspection of mosaic tissues remains common in the literature because quantification demands considerable labor and computational expertise. Practitioners must segment cell membranes or cell nuclei from a tissue and annotate the clones before their data are suitable for analysis. Here, we introduce Fly-QMA, a computational framework that automates each of these tasks for confocal microscopy images of <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs. The framework includes an unsupervised annotation algorithm that incorporates spatial context to inform the genetic identity of each cell. We use a combination of real and synthetic validation data to survey the performance of the annotation algorithm across a broad range of conditions. By contributing our framework to the open-source software ecosystem, we aim to contribute to the current move toward automated quantitative analysis among developmental biologists.</div>

Such allosteric pathways can be used as target for drug design, generating considerable interest in inferring them from sequence alignment data. Currently, different methods lead to conflicting results, in particular on the existence of long-range evolutionary couplings between distant amino-acids mediating allostery. Here we propose a resolution of this conundrum, by studying epistasis and its inference in models where an allosteric material is evolved <i>in silico</i> to perform a mechanical task. We find in our model the four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA predicts well the cost of point mutations but is a rather poor generative model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture long-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings. We propose that such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may be better suited to capture long-range effects.</div><hr>
